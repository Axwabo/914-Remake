# 914-Remake

A new iteration of the [original 914 app](https://github.com/Axwabo/914) of mine.
Shows SCP: Secret Laboratory's SCP-914 recipes.

This is also a PWA (progressive web app): it'll load super quickly after the initial visit,
and you can even install it to work offline!

For those unaware, SCP-914 is an anomalous machine that upgrades or downgrades items
placed in its input after selecting an upgrade setting and pressing a button.
It can be found in SCP:SL as a major part of gameplay, allowing players to obtain
high-level keycards from even the most basic ones.

The recipe extractor LabAPI plugin can be found in the `extractor` directory.
